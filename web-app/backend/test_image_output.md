# Description:
This bar graph represents sales data for the year 2024, segmented by quarters (Q1 to Q4). Each bar is color-coded to distinguish between the different quarters:

- **Q1** (depicted in blue) shows the lowest sales figures, indicating a gradual start to the year.
- **Q2** (represented in green) exhibits a moderate increase in sales, suggesting improvement over the first quarter.
- **Q3** (highlighted in red) stands out with the highest sales figures, indicating a peak in performance, possibly due to seasonal factors, successful promotions, or increased demand.
- **Q4** (colored orange) demonstrates a decline from Q3, suggesting a potential post-peak drop in sales, which could be influenced by various market dynamics or holiday purchasing behaviors.

Overall, the graph effectively visualizes the sales trend across the year, highlighting both growth and seasonal fluctuations in performance.
