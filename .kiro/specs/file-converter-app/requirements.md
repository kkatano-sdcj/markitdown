# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing a local desktop application that converts various file formats (docx, xlsx, PDF, pptx) to Markdown format. The application will integrate with OpenAI APIs for enhanced conversion capabilities, manage API tokens through a settings interface, and output converted files to user-specified local directories. The application will be packaged as an executable file for easy distribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select multiple files of different formats (docx, xlsx, PDF, pptx) and convert them to Markdown format, so that I can have a unified text format for my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a file selection interface
2. WHEN the user clicks the file selection button THEN the system SHALL open a file dialog that accepts .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, and .pptx files
3. WHEN the user selects one or more supported files THEN the system SHALL display the selected files in a list
4. WHEN the user initiates conversion THEN the system SHALL convert each file to Markdown format using the markitdown library
5. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL save the converted files to the specified output directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify where the converted Markdown files are saved, so that I can organize my converted documents in my preferred location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL provide an output directory selection interface
2. WHEN the user clicks the directory selection button THEN the system SHALL open a directory selection dialog
3. WHEN the user selects an output directory THEN the system SHALL display the selected path in the interface
4. WHEN files are converted THEN the system SHALL save all converted Markdown files to the specified directory
5. IF no output directory is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default directory and notify the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure OpenAI API settings through the application interface, so that I can enhance the conversion process with AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the settings menu THEN the system SHALL display an API configuration interface
2. WHEN the user enters an OpenAI API token THEN the system SHALL validate the token format
3. WHEN the user saves API settings THEN the system SHALL store the token securely in a local environment file
4. WHEN the system needs to make API calls THEN the system SHALL use the stored API token
5. IF the API token is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run as a standalone executable file, so that I can use it without installing Python or managing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development is complete THEN the system SHALL be packaged as an executable (.exe) file
2. WHEN the user runs the executable THEN the system SHALL start without requiring Python installation
3. WHEN the executable runs THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create necessary configuration directories if they don't exist

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a proper development environment with virtual environment isolation, so that I can manage dependencies effectively and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a Python virtual environment
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL install all required packages within the virtual environment
3. WHEN the virtual environment is activated THEN the system SHALL isolate project dependencies from system Python
4. WHEN development begins THEN the system SHALL have all necessary libraries (markitdown, OpenAI client, UI framework, etc.) installed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the conversion progress and status, so that I know when the process is complete and if any errors occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN each file is being processed THEN the system SHALL show the current file being converted
3. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the number of files converted
4. IF any conversion fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for failed files
5. WHEN all conversions are complete THEN the system SHALL enable the user to start a new conversion

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my API settings to persist between application sessions, so that I don't have to re-enter my configuration every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user saves API settings THEN the system SHALL store them in a local configuration file
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved API settings
3. WHEN the user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display the current saved configuration (with masked API tokens)
4. WHEN the user updates settings THEN the system SHALL overwrite the previous configuration
5. IF the configuration file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL create a new default configuration
